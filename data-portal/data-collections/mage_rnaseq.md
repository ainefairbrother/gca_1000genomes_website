The MAGE RNA-seq study provides the first large-scale transcriptome catalogue for the 1000 Genomes Project cell-lines. Total RNA from 731 immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), representing all 26 canonical 1000G populationsâ€”was sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (150 bp paired-end, poly-A selected, strand-specific).

The work is described in Population-scale RNA sequencing of 731 1000 Genomes lymphoblastoid cell lines - Taylor et al. (2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07708-2).

Data available includes:

- Raw FASTQ reads for each run (ENA BioProject PRJNA851328).
- Mate 1 and Mate 2 are provided as separate files.
- All FASTQs are hosted on the ENA FTP (ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk).

Files can be browsed by sample, population, and data type below.
