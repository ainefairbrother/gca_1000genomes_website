# Using data from IGSR

IGSR provides open data to support the community's research efforts. You can see our terms of use in our [data disclaimer](/IGSR_disclaimer). Please also consult the data reuse statements and cite associated publications appropriately. To cite IGSR, please use our [NAR paper](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/D1/D941/5580898?login=true).


# Explore the data sets in IGSR through our [data portal](/data-portal)  

IGSR shares data files from many studies via our FTP site. To make it easier to find the files you want, we present key data sets in our [data portal](/data-portal).

Files can be browsed by:

* sample (i.e. NA12878)
* population (i.e. Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria)
* technology (i.e. PacBio HiFi)
* data type (i.e. alignment)
* collection (i.e. 1000 Genomes Project phase three)

Our portal provides an [overview of the available collections and their associated publications](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection).
 
# View variants in genomic context in [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)

IGSR works alongside the [Ensembl genome browser](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html). Ensembl presents some of the key call sets in IGSR, placing the variation data in genomic context and adding up-to-date annotation of the variant data in their displays for [individual variations](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Explore?r=1:230709548-230710548;v=rs699;vdb=variation;vf=94).

In Ensembl you can:

* Browse data from the 1000 Genomes Project samples and other data sets on [GRCh38](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index)
* View data for a [specific variation](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Explore?r=1:230709548-230710548;v=rs699;vdb=variation;vf=94) and search by rsID
* View [population frequency](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Population?db=core;r=1:230709548-230710548;v=rs699;vdb=variation;vf=94) data
* Use a selection of [tools](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Population?db=core;r=1:230709548-230710548;v=rs699;vdb=variation;vf=94) to retrieve subsets of data, convert VCF to PED and calculate linkage disequilibrium

# Download data in bulk

We recommend downloading IGSR data via Globus ([instructions](https://www.internationalgenome.org/faq/can-i-access-1000-genomes-data-globus-online)). Data can also be downloaded via FTP ([FTP site](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/)) or Aspera ([instructions](https://www.internationalgenome.org/faq/how-download-files-using-aspera)). FTP access is subject to rate limiting, so it is essential to download local copies for your work rather than try to access via range queries remotely.

Data is organised by collection and includes data shared pre-publication, intermediate and working data as well as analysis files described in publications. A set of README files provides additional information.


#### 1000 Genomes Project - other data locations

Data from the original 1000 Genomes Project (pilot, phase 1 and phase 3 data) are also available at the following sites.

* [DDBJ](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/mirror_database/1000genomes/)
* [NCBI](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/)
* [AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/1000-genomes/)
